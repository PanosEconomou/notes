# Abelian Categories

To introduce tensor categories we will recall some facts about abelian categories first. These are more important to introduce structures that will pop up all the time later, rather than some more in-depth exploration. Here is also some [introduction to category theory](../Categories/Categories.md) that contains useful terminology. Most of these notes follow [EGNO - Tensor Categories](https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf).
