# Modular Tensor Categories 

In 1989 Moore and Seiberg showed that a (very large) class of Conformal Field Theories can be completely specified by some finite dimensional matrices that obey a couple of relations between them. These matrices were the F-symbols, R-Symbols, and the modular S-matrix, while the relations among them came to be known as the Pentagon and Hexagon equations. Using these one could "solve" (i.e. calculate all correlation functions) of a unique Conformal Field Theory. Yet, different sets of data would produce the same CFT, where it looked like we have made some "choice of basis" to define these matrices that our physics had no idea about. 

A Modular Tensor Category is the "basis-independent" way to express the data one needs to define a Conformal Field Theory. In these notes we will try to establish a quick overview of the language and calculation tools that Modular Tensor Categories offer us by following:

1. [TFT Construction of RCFT Correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0204148)
2. [Tensor Categories](https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf)
3. [Categories for the working mathematician](https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf)

We will try to keep it at least a bit CFT flavored in order to highlight the applicability and calculation tools in the context of physics.

# Chiral Algebra Constructions

The physical data encoded in the Modular Tensor Category associated with a rational CFT can equally as well be described using the representation theory of what's called a *Chiral Algebra* of the CFT. In some sense a Chiral algebra is a (often) semi-simple Lie algebra generated by the modes of the conserved currents on the theory. In the conformal case, it must always contain the Virasoro algebra $\text{Vir}$, which is the one generated by the modes of currents associated to conformal transformations. 

Therefore the *bulk Hilbert space* $\mathbb{H}$ of the theory can be arranged in representations of the chiral algebra $\mathcal{B}$. To be more precise we often assume that there are two such algebras, the chiral $\mathcal{B}$ and the antichiral algebra $\overline{\mathcal{B}}$ so $\mathbb{H}$ is actually arranged in representations of $\mathcal{B} \otimes \overline{\mathcal{B}}$. Since representations of the tensor product can be written in terms of tensor product of representations, we will focus for a while on representations of $\mathcal{B}$.
