# Idea

We are working on systems with a complicated Hamiltonian that express a robust phenomenon that we can essentially derive the dynamics based strictly on topology. When we are looking for symmetries we are looking for things that are really difficult to remove, as an example:

1. Time reversal symmetry (T)
2. Chiral Symmetry (C)
3. Sublattice Symmetry (S)

Let's define them more precisely. Namely notice that $T,C$ are anti-unitary symmetries, and $S$ is unitary symmetry. Specifically, 

**<u>Defnition:</u>** **Time reversal** for a unitary operator $U : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ is the antilinear map $\bar U$ such that $\bar U^\dagger H \bar U = H$. **Chiral symmetry** is such that $\bar U H \bar U = -H$, and **Sublattice** is $UHU = -H$.

Important properties of these are that $T^2 = U\bar U = \pm 1$ and so on.
