# True Topological Order

We are looking for truly topological states on systems. Let's start with an example

# Toric Code

The model we are considering is a square lattice in 2D with boundary and we put spin $1/2$ particles on the links. The Hamiltonian is 
$$
H = -J_e \sum_s A_s - J_m \sum_p B_p
$$
where $A_s$ sums over all the star points, and $B_p$ sums over all plaquettes. Notice that $[A_s,B_p] = 0$ for all $s,p$. If we put the syst
