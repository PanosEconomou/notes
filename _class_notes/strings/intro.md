## Resonances in strong interaction

We are looking for a way to explain the resonances observed in strong interactions. We do this outside from a QFT, and try to write down the amplitude directly using consistency conditions. 

**<u>Definition:</u>** The Veneziano amplitude is the one that satisfies the DHS (modular invariance) constrain on 2-2 scattering in hadronic interactions and has the form
$$
A(s,t) = \frac{\Gamma(-\alpha(s))\Gamma(-\alpha(t))}{\Gamma(-\alpha(s) - \alpha(t))},
$$
where $\alpha: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear function and $\Gamma$ is the Euler function defined by
$$
\Gamma(y) \coloneqq \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x} x^{y} e^{-x}.
$$


Additional constraints to the Veneziano amplitude is it's pole behavior, i.e. expansions at poles are well defined and match local interactions. There are interesting limits to take other than $s\to \infty, t \in \mathbb{R}$. You could instead fix $s/t$ and set both $s,t\to \infty$. (the zero mass particle is a)

While this did not explain strong hadron interactions, it has a nice geometric interpretations. Quantizing the NG Action we found that this amplitude has the same spectrum.
