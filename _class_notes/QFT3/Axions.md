# Axions

We will motivate and describe the construction of axions in QFT.

## Strong CP

In the lagrangian of particle physics we have the gluon term that is given by
$$
\text{Tr\,}\theta \, F\wedge F.
$$
This is a CP violating term which we can’t remove by the argument that CP must not be violated because the weak sector does this anyway. We can use experimental facts to actually obtain $\theta < 10^{-10}$. Phenomenologically, if we promote $\theta$ to a scalar field $a$ with some Higgs mass then we can see that the lagrangian would contain a term that looks like
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{axion}} = a F\wedge F + da\wedge \ast da - V(a).
$$
Let’s derive this! Let’s add a quark to the standard model lagrangian like so
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{SM} + i\langle Q,\centernot{D} Q\rangle - h\langle Q,\phi Q\rangle - V(\phi) + \langle d\phi,d\phi\rangle.
$$
We can break the $U(1)$ symmetry by the traditional procedure.
$$
\phi = \rho e^{i\alpha}
$$
where $m_\rho = \sqrt{\lambda} v$, but the $\alpha$ field is massless. So we get the following
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} + v^2 d\alpha \wedge \ast d\alpha - \alpha F\wedge F.
$$
What we can see is that this new $\alpha$ field interacts with gluons. We call $v = f_{pq}$ the Petchi-Quinn scale. So we got the lagrangian! What happens in the case of low Gev?  We should get an effective potential for $\alpha$. We do this using instantons but we haven’t covered them yet, so let’s not cry about it.
