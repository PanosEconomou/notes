# Momentum

One of the first thing I learned in classical physics is the concept of momentum as $p=mv$. Over time I learned that this was a very small part of the story. Angular momentum, energy, magnetic moment, spin, stress, and others kept creeping up over time. While position was a relatively strightfoward concept to understand, through coordinates, momentum had so many different forms that didn’t seem to be compatible with each other.

The purpose of this is to describe a general form of momentum that when applied to different circumstances it becomes the appropriate quantity we are used to. Furthermore, we will do it in such a way that this will lend itself to the intricate way that momentum becomes messed up in quantum mechanics. 

We will use [differential geometry](../Geometry/Bundles.md) as well as [representation theory](../Geometry/Lie_Crap.md) to build up the concept of the **momentum map**. We will then play around with Noether’s theorem and give some examples.

# Phase space

This will be done in the context of Hamiltonian mechanics. However, the only functional difference from Hamiltonian Field theory is that we allow for mathematical structures that are less rigid than smooth manifolds (like infinite dimensional manifolds, or vector bundles with with uncountably dimensional fibers). A more complete exploration of this with the structures encountered in field theory can be found [here](../Projects/CFT/Free_Fields.md#Phase_Spaces). For now we will restrict ourselfs in the classical case.
