# Gauging Discrete Symmetries

Here we describe how to gauge discrete symmetries using the language of defects. The main idea is to find ways to construct modular invariant partition functions of a theory that remains unaffected by the addition of symmetry defects. Here are some references

# Gauging Invertible Symmetries

Let's start by the example of Gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ defect. This is known as the orbifold procedure. This is a two step procedure.  

## Orbifold

 We want to construct a map between *consistent QFTs,* that takes the un-gaged CFT to a gauged CFT. This map is called the **orbifold** and we will carefully define what consistent means in this context. In essence this boils down to locality, unitarity, compactness, and unique ground state, being quantities that are preserved under this map. So let's be more careful.
