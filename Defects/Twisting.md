# Twisting Adventure

*Twisted Hilbert space.* “Oh just calculate the twisted Hilbert space by this defect.” “It’s just boundary conditions.” “You forgot to account for the twist fields.” “The operator at the endpoint of a TDL is a twisted field.” I swear to god after the first 10 minutes of learning defects you are bombarded with phrases like these as if talking about twisting Hilbert spaces is something you learned in Quantum 1. 

Unlike most of the notes here, this chunk is meant to motivate the existence of twisted Hilbert spaces and use a constructive approach to obtain intuition and familiarity. These notes are rigorous (i.e. not handwavy) but kept simple at the expense of generality. The point is to go through some constructive examples, and not to present a rigorous general framework, because what’s the point of chasing generality without a working understanding.

# Space is a Circle

One of the things we so often encounter in CFT is that the fields live on a circle. Yet, the space we are used to working in, almost without questioning it, is always something like an infinite line, so what gives? The answer presented in the big yellow book and others is 

>  “To eliminate any infrared divergences, we compactify the space coordinate.”

To that I say “wtf?” Even if one doesn’t know about infrared divergences this sounds like “we do it on a circle because a line is harder.” The more intuitive answer to why circle is much prettier and it has so much to do with what it means to be conformal.
