# Spinors

I am constantly scared every time I see a spinor and every time I hear anything about it. I don’t wanna deal with them, but here it is. 

## Wordy Introduction

When doing experimental particle physics we found out that not all particles are nicely described using scalar or vector fields (i.e. attaching a number or a vector in space). We found out that some of them are better described in the case where fields LOOK like attaching a vector at every point, but when we turn around, the vectors are not exactly stuck on the plane. In fact they look like they are rotating slower than the plane. Like they’re lagging behind in a sense. This would be such that when you do a full rotation of a plane they would have only done half a rotation in the same direction. **You can see why I hate them.** 

In here we will build a regorous description of doing this half rotation thing. Also we will build it in much generality, and then specify stuff. One of the cool results that given some spacetime (say Minkowski space) we will see is that this type of slow spinny vector (the spinor) cannot have any dimension! It has to have a specific dimension so that it is compatble with rotations in that spacetime. A simple example which will be helpful in guiding intuition is rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These rotations are always about an axis! So any vector that describes rotations HAS to have 3 dimensions to denote the axis. However, in $\mathbb{R}^2$ the situation is not as you expect, the rotation vector is still a member of $\mathbb{R}^3$ but it is just perpendicular to the plane having only one degree of freedom instead of 2 as we might have expected. As a result fixing information about the rotation kinda fixes the type of objects that we use to describe them. This is a sidenote that will become clearer as we go along, but it is nice to be slightly familiar with it when we come across it again.

How do we rigorously describe the disgusting concept of half rotation? It is not as simple as rotating by half the angle unfortunately. The way we do this is by constructing an algebraic construction, called a Clifford Algebra, that will help us describe the square root of the elements of the rotation group, in such a way that when we apply them twice we get the full rotation. Then we will form a group out of this Clifford Algebra square-root–of-a-group-thype-thing and then use a representation (a way to map a group element to an object that can transform quantum sates or whatnot) to a particular vector space that will contain our spinors. The representation will tell us how the spinors rotate. 



## Clifford Algebras

The first thing to talk about is more of a helper object, called a *Clifford algebra.* It was invented when people were trying to find out a way to take “the square root” of the laplace operator $\Delta = \sum_i \frac{\partial }{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial }{\partial x^i}$ . We now know that its square root is a different operator $\nabla = \sum_{i}\frac{\partial }{\partial x^i}  e_i$. Notice that even though $\nabla^2 = \Delta$ the object $\nabla$ clearly belongs to a different space because it can be thought of as a vector. This space is some Clifford algebra. The way we think about them, is that I give you a vector space and with some norm, and then you give me an algebra that contains elements that are interpreted as the square root of the norm. Finally, let’s be rigorous about this!

**<u>Definition:</u>** Given a vector space $V$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$ equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form $B$, a **Clifford Algebra** is an associative unital algebra $\text{Cl}(V,B)$ over $\mathbb{K}$ such that there exists a $\mathbb{K}$-linear map $\gamma: V \to \text{Cl}(V,B)$ such that for any $v\in V$

$$
\gamma(v)^2 = - B(v,v) \cdot 1,
$$

and for any other such map $\delta : V \to A$ to some other associative unital algebra $A$ that satisfied the same property, there exists a unique algebra homomorphism $\phi: \text{Cl}(V,B) \to A$ such that $\phi \circ \gamma = \delta$. 

The last property is called the universal property of the clifford algebra and is what helps us define it uniquely. We can alternatively approach the subject constructively by taking a quotient of the tensor algebra $T(V)$ generated by $V$ with the two sided ideal $I(Q) \coloneqq \text{span}\{v\otimes v + Q(v,v) \mid v \in V\}$. After doing this it takes some tedium to show uniqueness and we have an equivalent definition that I am not gonna formulate.
