# Conformal Boundaries

What happens when we try to do a 2D CFT on a manifold that has a Boundary? In these notes we describe what are boundary states, as well as conformal and topological defects that our theory can have.

# Modular Invariance

Before we talk about boundaries let's try to explore some relevant properties of Conformal Field Theories that should not be broken when we add a boundary. To study modular invariance we will talk about intertwiners. These are objects that map between representations of CFTs.
