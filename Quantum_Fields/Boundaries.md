# Conformal Boundaries

What happens when we try to do a 2D CFT on a manifold that has a Boundary? In these notes we describe what are boundary states, as well as conformal and topological defects that our theory can have.

# Modular Invariance

Before we talk about boundaries let's try to explore some relevant properties of Conformal Field Theories that should not be broken when we add a boundary. To study modular invariance we will talk about intertwiners. These are objects that map between representations of CFTs. 

## Complex Quotien Maps of Tori

To explain modular invariance, letâ€™s try to understand modular transformations. To do this, we need to understand how we can obtain a torus from the complex plane.

**<u>Lemma:</u>** Any complex number $\tau \in \mathbb H\subset \mathbb C $ in the upper half plane defines an equivalence relation on $\mathbb C$ such that
$$
z \sim z + n + m\tau,
$$
where $n,m\in \mathbb Z$. 

This is pretty clear to verify, but the picture is looks like this.

Essentially, each parallelogram is equivalent to each other, making it a donought.
