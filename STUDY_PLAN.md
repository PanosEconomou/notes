## Fusion Categories

Category theory with the goal of building up a rigorous understanding of fusion categories. It contains basic categories from [Mac Lane](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4721-8) (ML) and then transitioning to [EGNO](https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf) to specifically study tensor categories and build up fusion categories.

This is not done yet, but still.



## Minimal Models

A small review of minimal models primarily designed to give a bit of tangible CFT calculation practice. This is mostly from [Di-Francesco](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-2256-9) and [Schottenloher](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-68628-6).
