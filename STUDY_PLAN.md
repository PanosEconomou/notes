## Fusion Categories

Category theory with the goal of buildding up a rigorous understanding of fusion categories. It contains basic categories from [Mac Lane](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4721-8) (ML) and then transitioning to [EGNO](https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf) to specifically study tensor categories and build up fusion categories. 

- [x] [2 weeks] Welcome to Category Theory **(ML ch. 1-4)**
  - [x] Basic Constructions: (Meta-) categories, Functors, Natural transformations, Classification of Arrows.
  - [x] Categorical Structures: Duality, Products, Functor categories, Comma categories.
  - [x] Proof Constructions: Universals, Limits, Colimits, Sequences.
- [ ] [1.5 week] Categoryficaiton **(EGNO ch. 1-3)**
  - [ ] [2-3 days] Abelian Categories **(EGNO ch. 1)**: Additivive and Abelian categories, Exact sequences, Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem, Delingue tensor product, Group cohomology.
  - [ ] [1 week] Monoidal Categories and Rings **(EGNO ch. 2 & 3)**: Unit objects, Monoidal functors, Mac Lane strictness theorem, Coherence theorem, Rigid categories, Frobeneus-Perron theorem, Graded based rings, Complexification.
- [ ] [2 weeks] Tensor Categories **(EGNO ch. 4-7)**
  - [ ] [1.5 week] Constructions **(EGNO ch. 4)**: (Multi-) tensor categories, Grothendieck ring, Semisimplicity and products, Quantum traces, Chevalley property, Groupoids, Adjoint subcategories.
  - [ ] [1 week] Hopf Algebras and their Representations **(EGNO ch. 5)**



This is not done yet, but still.



## Representation Theory & CFT

Studying semisimple lie algebras and their representations with applications to Conformal Field Theory. This will follow [Di Francesco](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-2256-9) and some other textbooks I will find once I start reading it.
