## Leaf Amplitudes

The point of celestial holography is to map celestial amplitudes to correlators in the boundary CFT. There is the pretty identification that the Lorentz group in 3,1 is the same as the conformal group in 2. What we can say is that certain celestial amplitudes end up being singular due to translation invariance, so it isn't directly obvious on how to map these amplitudes to things in the CFT.
