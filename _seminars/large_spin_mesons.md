# Large Spin Mesons

In 3&4D lattice models we have seen that the spectrum of Glueballs doesn't change much in an $SU(N)$ theory as we lower $N$. It is interesting to study how the spectrum changes, and how to quantify these things.

**<u>Definition:</u>** A glueball is the lowest energy states of pure gluons in the Hilbert space.
