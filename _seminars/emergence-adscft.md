# Emergent Local Physics in AdS

If we can understand local physics in AdS we could play a nice game where the asymptotics looks a lot like the ones of asymptotically Minkowski. Here is how we do this.

We expect a 1-1 correspondence between QG states to CFT boundary states. This is often done with thermofield doublets in CFT by working at finite temperature. These are dual to states that create an eternal AdS black hole. But how do you describe the local aspects of this geometry using the CFT directly? Can you decouple them? 

Another better description of QG is via CFTs with many degrees of freedom. 

## Bulk Spacetime

Bulk spacetime arises from emergent (appearing in the $N\to \infty$ limit) Von-Neumann type -III1 algebras on the "boundary." There is a subregion and subalgebra duality. We are interested in algebras because they describe collections of probable observables. Sometimes it is not possible to have Hilbert spaces (This happens in time dependent Hilbert spaces/i.e. we need a covariant configuration space) operator algebras are insensitive to that.

## Local Algebras

A **local algebra**  (Type I) is a the algebra of all *bounded linear operators* on some Hilbert space that describes our **observable** physics. A local state is a density matrix where we  partially traced out the environmental Hilbert space. 

This is in quantum mechanics. IN relativistic QFT we have a problem. We can factorize the Hilbert space in the left and right regions of the Rindler decomposition of the Minkowski space. However, this is inconsistent. Therefore the Hilbert space is Ill defined. However, the algebras of observables, really do factorize! This is done through the language of Type III1 algebras.

To construct these, we take as the operators to be only the ones that are well defined in the large N-limit. Then we call these dense, and complete it with something called the GNS construction. We essentially complete such that the **commutant of the commutant** is the same algebra (forcing commutant functor to be involutive).

## Thermofield Double

Consider two copies of the CFT of the boundary and essentially calculate a thermal state for the two copies at some temperature $\beta$. What we know already is that below the Hawking page transition we will have two copies of type I algebras, but above it we get a type III1. This is actually pretty cool because this kind of algebra imposes causality. 

## Subregion/Subalgebra

What we see is that since the algebras are identified, the subalgebras are identified too - at the large $N$ limit (only).
