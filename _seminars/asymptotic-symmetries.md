## Maxwell

Consider some version of maxwell
$$
S = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{M} F\wedge \ast F + S_M,
$$
 where $S_M$ is a version of a **matter** action that leads to a conserved current $J$. So we can write our equations in the form $dF =  0$ and $d\ast F = \ast J$. Knowing $J$ we can solve the wave equations for $F$.
