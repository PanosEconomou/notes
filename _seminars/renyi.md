We have a manifold $A$ and want to calculate the trace
$$
\Tr \rho_A^q.
$$
This is effectively defined as some $\rho_A = Z(A\times I, D)$ for some data $D$ so we have that
$$
\text{Tr} \rho_A = Z (A\times I \sqcup A\times I,D ) = Z(A\times S^1,D).
$$
The idea is to express this as a correlation function on a different theory, in particular the orbifold. Yey. This would be the correlation function of the two endpoint operators.
