# Generalized Tube Algebras

Let's try to understand that Tube algebra we get by taking $\text{Fib}\boxtimes \text{Fib}$ and including one extra line corresponding to the outer automorphism that exchanges the two $\text{Fib}$ copies. We follow [Generalized Tube Algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159) for the majority of this, but let's just
