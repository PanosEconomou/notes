# notes
Incomplete, hard to understand notes on various subjects that at some point I needed to learn about.





<!-- tree generated by markdown-notes-tree starts here -->

- [**Analysis**](Analysis)  
    Honestly emptier than it should be...
    - [Functional Analysis](Analysis/Functional_Analysis.md)
- [**Geometry**](Geometry)  
    Key intuition or formal definitions of Differential Geometry Concepts because I forget.
    - [Automorphism Groups of Vector Spaces](Geometry/Common_Vector_Space_Groups.md)
